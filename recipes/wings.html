        <h2>This is a delicious pizza that replaces the cheese!</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 lbs chicken wings</li>
            <li>5 teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>3/4 teaspoons salt</li>
            <li>4 Tbsp unsalted butter, mixed</li>
            <li>1/2 cup Frank's Original Hot Sauce<li>
            <li>1 Tbsp brown sugar</li>    
            <li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
            <li>1/2 cup crumbled blue cheese, softened</li>    
            <li>1/2 cup sour cream</li>
            <li>1/4 cup mayonnaise</li>
            <li>1 clove small garlic, minced</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp lemon juice</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
            <li>Black pepper</li>
            <li>Celery sticks</li>
        </ul>

        <ol>
            <li>If you plan ahead, lay the wings on a rack on a rimmed baking tray and let them dry uncovered in the fridge overnight. Alternatively, pat them dry with paper towels.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 250째F/120째C (all oven types). Put one oven shelf in the lower quarter of the oven and one in the top quarter.</li>    
            <li>Line the tray with foil. Spray the rack on the baking tray with oil.</li>   
            <li>Place the wings in a large bowl. Sprinkle over baking powder and salt. Use hands to toss well (or shake in ziplock bag) to coat wings evenly./li>   
            <li>Place the wings skin side up on the rack (ok if snug, they shrink). Bake on the lower shelf in the oven for 30 minutes.</li>   
            <li>Then move the tray up to the higher shelf and turn the oven up to 425째F / 220째C. Bake for a further 40 to 50 minutes, rotating the tray halfway through. The wings do not need to be turned over. </li>  
            <li>Toss with Hot Sauce and serve immediately with Blue Cheese Dip and celery sticks. They can be served plain, with a dipping sauce or tossed in sauce. Wings also reheat crispy!</li> 
            <li>The wings are ready when they are dark golden brown and the skin is very crispy.</li>    
        </ol>
